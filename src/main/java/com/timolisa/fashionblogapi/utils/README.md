Components:
1. Authentication filter: It is a filter in the filter chain that detects an authentication attempt and forwards it to the the AuthenticationManager.
2. Authentication: This component specifies the type of authentication to be conducted. Its implementation specifies the type of Authentication to be carried out. Example: UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken or RememberMeAuthenticationToken etc.
3. AuthenticationManager: its role is to delegate the authenticate() call to the correct AuthenticationProvider by calling their supports() method, if it returns true, then that AuthenticationProvider supports the Authentication type and is then used to carry out the authentication.
4. AuthenticationProvider: It is an interface whose implementation processes a certain type of authentication. It has an authenticate() method, that takes an Authentication type and performs authentication on it. On successful authentication, the AuthenticationProvider returns an Authentication object with the authenticated property set to `true` else it throws an Authentication exception. The token is returned to the AuthenticationManager. On successful authentication, the SecurityContext is updated with the details of the currently authenticated user. SecurityContext can be used in several parts of the app to check whether any user is currently authenticated, get their details.
